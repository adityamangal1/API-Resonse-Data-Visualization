## Authentication
It is a completely open API. No authentication is required to query and get data. This also means that we've limited what you can do to just GET-ing the data.


## JSON Schema
All resources support JSON Schema. Making a request to /API/<resource>/schema will give you the details of that resource. This will allow you to programmatically inspect the attributes of that resource and their types.

## Encodings
This API provides two encodings for you to render the data with:


## JSON
JSON is the standard data format provided by Covid API by default.
